Each integration server runs as a unique operating system process in a separate address space. Previous versions of this software product (IBM Integration Bus v10, IBM Integration Bus v9, WebSphere Message Broker v8 etc.) have also included integration servers, but App Connect Enterprise v11 is the first version to allow Integration Server processes to be entirely stand-alone, and defined independently from an integration node. An integration node provides a higher level operating system process, as part of a wider process hierarchy, which is designed to look after the integration servers which are associated with the integration node.  In the past integration nodes have also taken on other responsibilities such as executing new deployments, configuring updates to the server processes and serving the product's administrative REST API."
